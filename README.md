# Yinsh-backend
Yinsh is a very interesting abstract board game. This repository is just a small prototype in FSharp to see how to implement a board game like that in a functional way. A similar project in python is on the way. The idea of this repository is to serve as a learning and show-off project in speeches and trainings.
